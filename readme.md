#### Canisters

Adds a logistic challenge and extended integration of modded materials.  
Canisters are added as an additional ingredient for rocket fuel.  

Rocket silo launched cargo pods deliver the canisters.  
Canisters are subject to an attrition loss per launch.  
Set the startup option to 0 to disable attrition and set it to 100 for no canisters to be returned.  

Startup Options:  
Select the metal for the recipe (default: Steel)  
Select the percent of attrition (default: 10%)  

Canister recipe:  
1 steel plate (or 2 tin plate or 1 titanium plate)  
Additionally, if glass is available, the recipe will include 1 glass (plate)
