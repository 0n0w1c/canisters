#### Adds reuseable (or disposable) rocket fuel canisters  

Adds a canister as an additional ingredient for rocket fuel.  
And subsequently, nuclear and plutonium fuels.
When a canister fuel is used, the empty canister is returned.  
This is true for planes, trains and automobiles.

Startup option to enable reuseable canisters (default: enabled)  
Disable the option for disposable canisters, which are not returned.

Cargo pods will deliver 50 reusable canisters<sup>\*</sup> to the space platform hubs.  
These are not accounted for with in-game platform hub inventory checks.  
<sup>\*</sup> - Tin is a bit fragile for the harsh rigors of space, not all will be returned.

Startup option to either spill or void canisters on space platform hub inventory overflows  
(Applies only when canisters are reuseable)  

Canister recipe:  
1 steel plate (or 2 tin plate or 1 titanium plate)  
Additionally, if Glass is active, the recipe will include 1 glass plate
