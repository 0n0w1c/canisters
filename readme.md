## Canisters
Introduces reusable (or disposable) canisters  

Adds a logistic challenge and extended integration of modded materials.  

Canisters are added as an additional ingredient for rocket fuel.  
When rocket (nuclear/plutonium) fuel is used, an empty canister is returned.  
This is true for "planes, trains and automobiles".  

Rocket silo rocket launched cargo pods deliver the empty canisters.  
These canisters are subject to a random attrition per launch.  
Set the startup option to 0, to disable attrition. 

Startup Options:  
Enable reusable canisters (default: Enabled)  
Select the metal for the recipe (default: Steel)  
Select the maximum percent of attrition (default: 10%)  

Canister recipe:  
1 steel plate (or 2 tin plate or 1 titanium plate)  
Additionally, if glass is available, the recipe will include 1 glass (plate)
