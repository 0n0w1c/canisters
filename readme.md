## Canisters
Introduces reuseable (or disposable) canisters

A canister becomes an additional ingredient for rocket fuel.  
When rocket (nuclear/plutonium) fuel is used, an empty canister is returned.  
This is true for "planes, trains and automobiles".  

Cargo pods will deliver reusable canisters<sup>\*</sup> to the space platform hubs.  
Note: These are not accounted for with in-game platform hub inventory checks.  
( <sup>\*</sup> ) - Tin is a bit fragile for the harsh rigors of space, but economical.  

Startup option to enable reuseable canisters. (default: enabled)  
Disable the option for disposable canisters, which are not returned.  

Startup option to either spill or void canisters on inventory overflows.  

Startup option to select the metal for the recipe, if Tin and/or Titanium is active.

Canister recipe:  
1 steel plate (or 2 tin plate or 1 titanium plate)  
Additionally, if Glass is active, the recipe will include 1 glass plate
